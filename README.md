<h1 style="border-bottom: 2px solid lightgray;">TriPercept:  Bridging the Structural Perception Gap in Molecular Graphs</h1>

__Abstract:__ Accurate molecular property prediction requires a balanced perception of struc- tural information at multiple levels, including atomic attributes, topological patterns, and geometric configurations.  However, most existing models rely on a single struc- tural view, resulting in structural perception imbalance and poor generalization across tasks.   Given  the  inherent  complementarity  of these structural levels,  we introduce TriPercept, a unified representation learning framework designed to unify and integrate them.  TriPercept extracts atomic, topological, and geometric features via dedicated encoders, combines them through a structure-aware graph network that incorporates heterogeneous edge information into message passing, and reinforces structural con- sistency through contrastive self-supervised pretraining.  Evaluated on multiple clas- sification and regression tasks from MoleculeNet, TriPercept consistently outperforms competitive baselines on the majority of tasks, especially in structurally diverse sce- narios. Further experiments, including t-SNE visualizations of feature embeddings and atomic-level attention heatmaps, demonstrate the effectiveness of TriPerceptâ€™s multi- level structural fusion, highlighting its ability to focus on chemically relevant features and capture complex structural relationships.
